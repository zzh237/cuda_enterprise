# CUDA Sobel Filter Project
This is a project demonstrating the implementation of the Sobel filter using CUDA, created as part of the "CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise" Coursera course.

## Project Description

The Sobel filter, or Sobel operator, is used in image processing primarily for edge detection. The operator uses two 3Ã—3 convolution kernels which are applied to the original image to produce separate measurements of the gradient in the x and y directions.

This CUDA-based implementation speeds up the Sobel filter processing by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs.

The application inputs a greyscale N by M image and outputs an N by M image (in PPM format) highlighting the edges detected in the original image.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using the provided Makefile.
2. Run the program by providing a path to a greyscale image:
3. The program will output a new PPM image with edges highlighted.

## Example
For a demonstration, you can run the provided `run.sh` script which applies the Sobel filter to a sample greyscale image.

Input and output examples can be found in `data/panda.ppm` and `data/panda-sobel.ppm`, respectively.
